					Header fields are lines composed of a field name, followed by a colon
					(":"), followed by a field body, and terminated by CRLF.  A field
					name MUST be composed of printable US-ASCII characters (i.e.,
					characters that have values between 33 and 126, inclusive), except
					colon.  A field body may be composed of any US-ASCII characters,
					except for CR and LF.  However, a field body may contain CRLF when
					used in header "folding" and  "unfolding" as described in section
					2.2.3.  All field bodies MUST conform to the syntax described in
					sections 3 and 4 of this standard.
