            /* RFC 4616.2. PLAIN SASL Mechanism.                
                The mechanism consists of a single message, a string of [UTF-8]
                encoded [Unicode] characters, from the client to the server.  The
                client presents the authorization identity (identity to act as),
                followed by a NUL (U+0000) character, followed by the authentication
                identity (identity whose password will be used), followed by a NUL
                (U+0000) character, followed by the clear-text password.  As with
                other SASL mechanisms, the client does not provide an authorization
                identity when it wishes the server to derive an identity from the
                credentials and use that as the authorization identity.
