            A service SHOULD allow a publisher to delete an item once it has been published to a node that

            To delete an item, the publisher sends a retract request as shown in the following examples. 
            The <retract/> element MUST possess a 'node' attribute and SHOULD contain one <item/> element
            (but MAY contain more than one <item/> element for Batch Processing of item retractions); 
            the <item/> element MUST be empty and MUST possess an 'id' attribute.
