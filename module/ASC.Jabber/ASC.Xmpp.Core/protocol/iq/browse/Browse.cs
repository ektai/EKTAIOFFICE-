// JEP-0011: Jabber Browsing
//
// This JEP defines a way to describe information about Jabber entities and the relationships between entities. 
// Note: This JEP is superseded by JEP-0030: Service Discovery.

// WARNING: This JEP has been deprecated by the Jabber Software Foundation. 
// Implementation of the protocol described herein is not recommended. Developers desiring similar functionality should 
// implement the protocol that supersedes this one (if any).

// Most components and gateways still dont implement Service discovery. So we must use jabber:iq:browse for them until everything
// is replaced with JEP 30 (Service Discovery).
