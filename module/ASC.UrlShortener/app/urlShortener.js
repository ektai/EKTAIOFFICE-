/**
 * ShortURL: Bijective conversion between natural numbers (IDs) and short strings

 * ShortURL.encode() takes an ID and turns it into a short string
 * ShortURL.decode() takes a short string and turns it into an ID
 *
 * Features:
 * + large alphabet (51 chars) and thus very short resulting strings
 * + proof against offensive words (removed 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u')
 * + unambiguous (removed 'I', 'l', '1', 'O' and '0')

 * Example output:
 * 123456789 <=> pgK8p
